### Day 1: March 26, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic JavaScript Tutorial 
**Thoughts**: A lot of information to take in. Went over some old ground but started grasping the fundamentals of complex variables using objects.

### Day 2: March 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the OO Javascript tutorial on FCC and worked through half the Basic Algos. Did some fix work on my profile but hit a blockage with alignment of my Icon's and Navbar Items, need to do more reserach into the problem. Secured a new website build for South X Southwest Sportfishing (Rob T). Hopefuly will be starting that this week.
**Thoughts**: It was great to be working on the Algo challenges, some were quite tough! By the end of the day after several hours my brain was frazzled and couldn't get the last algo cracked.
